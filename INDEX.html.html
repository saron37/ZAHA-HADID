          Zaha Hadid was born in Baghdad Iraq (1950)  and commenced her college studies at 
          the American University in Beirut in the field of mathematics. She moved to London
           in 1972 to study architecture at the Architectural Association and upon graduation 
           in 1977, she joined the Office of Metropolitan Architecture (OMA). She also taught 
           at the Architectural Association (AA) with OMA collaborators Rem Koolhaas and Elia Zenghelis.

She began her own practice in London in 1980 and won the prestigious competition for the Hong Kong
 Peak Club, a leisure and recreational center in 1983. Painting and drawing, especially in her early
  period, are important techniques of investigation for her design work. Ever since her 1983 
  retrospective exhibition at the AA in London, her architecture has been shown in exhibitions 
  worldwide and many of her works are held in important museum collections.

Known as an architect who consistently pushes the boundaries of architecture and urban design,
 her work experiments with new spatial concepts intensifying existing urban landscapes and 
 encompassing all fields of design, from the urban scale to interiors and furniture.

She is well-known for some of her seminal built works, such at the Vitra Fire Station (1993), 
Weil am Rhein, Germany, the Mind Zone at the Millennium Dome (1999) Greenwich, UK, a ski jump 
(2002) in Innsbruck, Austria and the Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art (2003) in Cincinnati, 
Ohio. Parallel with her private practice, Hadid has continued to be involved in academics, holding
 chairs and guest professorships at Harvard University, Yale University, the University of Illinois 
 at Chicago, Columbia University, the University of Visual Arts in Hamburg and the University of 
 Applied Arts in Vienna.

    <p>
    
      zaha hadid's vision is to provide services 
      in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the 
      site surrounding the buildings that have human occupancy in order to 
      make the world a better and suitable place to live.

    <p>
      zaha hadid's goal is to be involved with the total revitalization of a community or communities 
      via public and private architecture & design; a multidisciplinary firm that handles 
      all aspects of design: spatial, graphic, internet, information, media, typographic, etc.
      And of course, this would include being not only a design firm, but a developer who's 
      ideas get implemented without much client interference.<br><br><br><br>

    <h1 id="story04"> DISIGN RESEARCH &nbsp &nbsp <a class="link1" href="#HOME">HOME</a> </h1>  
    <p>
      Architecture as a material practice is predominately based on an approach to design 
      that is characterised by prioritising the elaboration of form over its subsequent 
      materialisation. Since the Renaissance the increasing division between processes of 
      design and making has led to the age-long development and increasing dependence on 
      representational tools intended for explicit, scalar geometric descriptions that at 
      the same time serve as instructions for the translation from drawing to building. 
      Inevitably, and with few exceptions, even in today’s digital practice architects embrace 
      design methods that epitomize the hierarchical separation of form definition and 
      materialisation.<br><br>

The research of zaha hadid explores an alternative, morphogenetic approach to design that 
unfolds morphological complexity and performative capacity from material constituents without 
differentiating between formation and materialisation processes. This requires an understanding 
of form, material, structure and environment not as separate aspects, but rather as complex
 interrelations that are embedded in and explored through integral computational processes.<br>

The notion of material system constitutes one central aspect of this research. Material system 
does not only refer to the material constituents of a building alone, but rather describes, in 
a system-theoretical sense, the complex reciprocity between materiality, form, structure and 
space, the related processes of production and assembly, and the multitude of performative effects 
that emanate from the interaction with environmental influences and forces. This conceptualization 
of material systems enables the utilization of computational design processes. The ability of 
computation to simultaneously do both, stochastically derive and systemically process complex 
datasets within a defined or evolving constraint space, can be utilized to explore a material 
system’s performative capacity within its materially determined limits. Furthermore, continuously 
informing the form generation with different modes of computational analysis enables a direct 
link between the ontogeny, the history of structural changes of an individual, and its interaction 
with external forces and energy respectively, that is its ecological embedding. This enables to 
conceive of material systems as the synergetic outcome of calibrating and balancing multiple 
influencing variables and divergent design criteria, which always already include the interaction 
with the system-external environment. The resultant environmental modulations can now be understood
 as highly specific patterns in direct relation to the material interventions from which they 
 originate.<br>

The design of space, structure and climate can be synthesized in integrative computational design 
processes.
